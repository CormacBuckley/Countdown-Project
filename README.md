# Countdown-Project
End of first year programming assignment written in C 

This is a project that I have worked on over the last number of weeks as an end of year assignment for my programming module.

The general idea of the game is to mimic the television show Countdown in that the player asked wheter they would like a vowel or a consonant a number of times and is then presented with a series of randomly generated vowels and consonants.From this list of letters the player must try and make the largest word they can. The program will then check the external dictionary text file to find the largest word that could have been made from the letters and present this word to the player.
